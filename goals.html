            <h2>Goles</h2>
            <p>in sport our goals is: </p>
            <p id="G-1">Goal 1 Regular sport causes more oxygen to be drawn into the body with carbon monoxide and
                waste gases
                expelled.
                This increases the lung capacity during sport, improving lung function and efficiency.</p>
            <p id="G-2">Goal 2 Your heart is a muscle and needs frequent exercise to help it keep fit and healthy. A
                healthy
                heart can
                pump blood efficiently around your body. Your heart will improve in performance when it is regularly
                challenged with exercise. Stronger hearts can improve overall health of the body.</p>
            <p id="G-3">Goal 3 By training frequently and working towards seasonal goals you can build your
                confidence and
                abilities.
                This is especially noticeable through tournaments and matches where you and your team put your skills to
                the test. Small, incremental achievements throughout the year can build personal confidence over time,
                giving you the ability to take on new projects and assignments at work with your new-found confidence.
            </p>
            <p id="G-4">Goal 4 When you are physically active your mind gets a chance to unplug from daily stresses
                and strains
                of life.
                Physical exercise reduces the stress hormones in your body and stimulates the release of endorphins.
                These endorphins may give you more energy and focus for whatever life has.</p>
            <p id="g-5">Goal 5 Fast Company suggests that exercise and sport triggers chemicals in the brain that can
                make you
                feel
                happier and relaxed. Team sports provide a chance to unwind and take part in an activity that improves
                your fitness. If you play sports outside, you can benefit from fresh air which is said to promote a good
                nightâ€™s sleep.</p>
