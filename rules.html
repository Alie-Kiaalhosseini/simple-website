            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <div class="r-txt-2">
                <p id="R-1">Whenever playing in any type of sporting event you must always have respect for and show
                    respect
                    towards your opponents.</p>
                <p id="R-2">Referees should be shown respect at all times before, during and after any sporting event.
                </p>
                <p id="R-3">In any sporting event, the coach should be seen as the boss of all the players. No worker
                    would
                    show disrespect to their boss and think that they would get away with it.</p>
                <p id="R-4">It's not a good idea to push yourself through pain or discomfort. Being an athlete requires
                    you
                    to have a long-term vision of your future-self. Getting the win is important, but your health and
                    safety
                    is always the most important rule.</p>
                <p id="R-5">Players should always show respect to their teammates and never try to show them up. Any
                    player's teammates are extremely important and the key to winning games.</p>
                <p id="R-6">Sports, as well as life, are made up of small wins and moments. The small victories are what
                    truly builds up to the final product and what leads to the bigger things that make people happy.</p>
                <p id="R-7">Not only in sports, but throughout life, a person should always be pushing themselves to do
                    the
                    best work that they can do.</p>
                <p id="R-8">The reason people begin playing sports is because it is a lot of fun to play, watch, and be
                    a
                    part of every sport.</p>
                <p id="R-9">At the completion of a sporting event or match, athletes should always keep these rules in
                    mind
                    and no matter the result of the game, all players should leave with class.</p>
                <p id="R-10">During sports, any athlete is bound to make some sort of mistake during their career or
                    fail
                    when they need to succeed the most.</p>
